          Scottsdale Chiropractor Dr. Thoma is a NUCCA chiropractor, which is a gentle, specific, scientific adjustment to the upper cervical spine (Atlas, C1).  A balanced spine and active care cultivates optimal health and wellness leading to decreased spine and joint pain, headaches, fatigue, as well as other symptoms.

          “For those of you wanting to facilitate a complete recovery of any patient, friend, relative, or even yourself, I strongly suggest an evaluation by a NUCCA doctor. Until you have a fully functional upper cervical spine, your rehabilitation program is far from complete!”

          The NUCCA chiropractic approach to spinal health is very unique compared to other chiropractic methods. NUCCA chiropractic treatment involves a very light touch to the first cervical vertebra (upper cervical spine) to realign the spine, balance the spinal column and relieve stress and pain on the major nerves that passes through the vertebrae.

          Dr. Thoma, Scottsdale Chiropractor, uses a system of chiropractic spinal analysis that focuses on improving the patient’s health and well-being with structural correction.  We look at the body as a whole.  When the spine is in alignment this decreases chances of injury, neck, back, shoulder, hip, knee and other joint pain, as well as improve function and performance.
