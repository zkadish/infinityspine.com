          Scottsdale chiropractor and physiotherapist Dr. Thoma assesses spine and joint structure and function to design a corrective therapy program that is custom to your individual needs–athletic, auto accident, acute or chronic pain relief.  Assessment is the key to the success of our treatment.  Without optimally assessing your condition, it is next to impossible to provide optimal treatment.
