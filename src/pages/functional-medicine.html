        <!-- <h2>Testing of Saliva, Blood, Urine and Stool</h2>
        <div>
          Infinity Spine Center’s tests go beyond testing for the usual irregularities that typical doctor’s test for.  We seek to find out what is the underlying cause of the patient’s health condition, as opposed to just treating the symptoms.  By running a multitude of tests, we can help you identify various health conditions that may have been overlooked by others.
