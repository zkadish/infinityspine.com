          Our whole-body light therapy treatment called Photobiomodulation therapy (PBM), previously known as Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), is the application of red and near-infrared light to body where there is degeneration or injury.  Our PBM helps to improve, repair, and reduce inflammation and pain. PBM technology offers drug-free pain relief and regenerative healing, in 4-minute treatments. By increasing ATP and reducing oxidative stress, our PBM creates a cascade of mitochondrial and intracellular downstream effects leading to improved tissue repair and reduced inflammation.

          Every cell in our body has millions of energy generators called the mitochondrion. These mitochondria are responsible for providing most of the required ATP for cells – a chemical responsible for energy release within cells. Not only responsible for energy, ATP drive a multitude of cellular and physiological functions including those directly related to injury repair and pain relief.
        </div>
        <div>
          When a cell is damaged through injury or trauma, or when cells get stressed (perhaps due to disease, injury or aging) the mitochondria produces nitric oxide (NO). Once, this happens the production of ATP is drastically reduced, or in some cases, stopped altogether.  As a result, the rate of healing slows dramatically.
        </div>
        <div>
          That’s where our PBM comes in. Using PBM delivered at the right frequency to affected cells, causes the mitochondria to spring into action almost immediately, producing increased amounts of ADP. The ADP then links with free oxygen singlets to produce ATP.  Again, infra-red light increases the production of ATP in damaged or resting mitochondria.
        </div>
        <div>
          At the correct wavelength, density and intensity, PBM will displace nitric oxide allowing oxygen back in, so ATP is restored and oxidative stress reduced. So, once your normal mitochondrial function is restored, cell metabolism is improved and healing will occur much quicker.

          Our whole body PBM offers drug-free pain relief, regenerative healing, and improved tissue regeneration using treatments of 4 minutes in duration. By increasing ATP production, and reducing oxidative stress, our PBM provides a multitude of benefits, including:
